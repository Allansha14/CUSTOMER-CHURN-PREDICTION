# CUSTOMER-CHURN-PREDICTION

Overview
This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict customer churn for a subscription-based service or business. Using historical customer data from a U.S. bank, which includes features such as usage behavior and customer demographics, we will explore different algorithms like Logistic Regression, Random Forests, and Gradient Boosting to predict whether a particular customer will leave the bank.
