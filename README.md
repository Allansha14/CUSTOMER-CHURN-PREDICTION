# CUSTOMER-CHURN-PREDICTION

Overview :
This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict customer churn for a subscription-based service or business. Using historical customer data from a U.S. bank, which includes features such as usage behavior and customer demographics, we will explore different algorithms like Logistic Regression, Random Forests, and Gradient Boosting to predict whether a particular customer will leave the bank.

Objective :
The objective is to build a predictive model that can identify customers who are likely to churn. By accurately predicting churn, the bank can take proactive measures to retain these customers, thus reducing churn rates and improving customer satisfaction.
